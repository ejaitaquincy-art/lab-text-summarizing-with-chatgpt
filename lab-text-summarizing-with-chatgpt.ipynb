    "## Report:Prompt Engineering Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we explored how different prompt formulations influence the quality, focus, and usefulness of generated summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "We experimented with multiple prompt styles beyond basic summarization, including emotional tone detection, problem extraction, and internal business rewriting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The emotional-tone prompt produced insight into customer satisfaction rather than product features. This demonstrated how instructions can shift model attention from facts to sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem-extraction prompt significantly reduced verbosity and removed positive bias. However, it occasionally omitted subtle complaints when they were framed indirectly. This shows that restrictive prompts improve precision but may reduce recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "The internal-feedback rewrite produced structured and actionable outputs. This version was especially useful in transforming informal reviews into professional business language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Across experiments, we observed that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- More specific role framing improves relevance.\n",
    "- Constraints (word limits, focus areas) reduce hallucinations.\n",
    "- Extraction prompts are more deterministic than summarization prompts.\n",
    "- Rewriting prompts improve usability for real-world applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some prompt variations failed when instructions were too vague. In those cases, the model reverted to generic summaries instead of task-specific outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt design directly shapes model reasoning pathways. Clear objectives and constraints lead to more reliable and operational outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, prompt engineering is not about asking better questions, but about defining the task environment precisely.\n"
